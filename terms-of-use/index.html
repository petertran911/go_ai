            <h2>Subscription and Payment</h2>
            <p>
              As explained in the sections above, Users can access and try the
              App’s functionalities without being charged with a fee nor
              implying any cost. However, if Users wish to export the desired
              image without the included watermark and/or with a certain quality
              and size, and/or want to increase the number of images they can
              generate, they must choose a subscription plan. The App will
              display several subscription options from weekly to yearly
              subscriptions to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of the
              User. The App also offers a catalog of quota packs that can be
              purchased by subscribed Users to further increase the number of AI
              images they can generate within a determined period of time.
            </p>
            <h4>Remarks:</h4>
            <p>
              - By subscribing to a plan, the User acknowledges and accepts the
              price and receipt of an automatic and recurring billing charge
              based on the chosen option.
            </p>
            <p>
              - By purchasing a quota pack, the User acknowledges and accepts
              the price and receipt of the corresponding billing charge based on
              the chosen option.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Once purchased, the quota packs will expire and, therefore, will
              stop being available for User to use, when any or all
              (alternatively or cumulatively) of the following circumstances are
              met:
            </p>
            <p>
              (i) the User unsubscribes from the then current active
              subscription plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              (ii) after 12 months of the date of the quota pack’s purchase by
              the User.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The Company reserves the right to update the types, conditions
              and price of the subscription plans and quota packs offered, at
              any time, depending on its business objectives, strategy and
              needs, without prior notice to Users. Changes will be effective
              when published on the App.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The subscription plan and quota packs costs may vary depending
              on the country/state selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The subscription plan and quota packs costs will be charged to
              the debit/credit card associated with the User account in
              Apple/Google. The User can see the invoices in the Account
              section.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The subscription plan will be automatically renewed at the end
              of the recurring billing period if the User does not cancel it (to
              avoid the charges, the User must cancel at least 24 hours before
              the end date of the current service period). The renewal will be
              for the same fixed-term period.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Bear in mind that directly removing the App from your device,
              does not imply the deactivation of the subscription plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              - If the User has requests in regards to the charges made, you
              must directly contact Apple or Google, as applicable.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              - If recurring billing cannot be processed correctly, the Company
              reserves the right to either interrupt and/or block the User’s
              access to the App without previous notice. Therefore, the User
              shall ensure that its payment method is active and/or it has
              sufficient funds for charging the subscription price.
            </p>
