              recipients located in countries that ensure an adequate level of
              data protection or, failing that, offer the appropriate safeguards
              required by the current applicable law and regulations on the
              protection of personal data, in order to ensure that your personal
              data is properly protected and that your individual rights and
              freedoms are guaranteed. In this regard, please be informed that
              the third parties mentioned above are committed with standard
